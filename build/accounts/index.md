#Accounts
There are three main types of accounts on Mookh viz; buyer, seller and admin. Although one does not necessarily need to have a user account to purchase items on Mookh, by default, any new user is a buyer.
###Buyer
One can sign up as buyer by accessing the Mookh directory at [mookh.com](https://mookh.com).
###Seller
One can sign up as seller or merchant by accessing the Mookh dashboard at [sellers.mookh.com](https://sellers.mookh.com).
###Admin
Administrator accounts are limited and can only be created for Mookh staff.
